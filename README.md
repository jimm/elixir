# Jim's Elixir Experiments

This repo contains my experiments with Elixir.

## CryptoPals

http://cryptopals.com/, though I'm also working on those in Clojure.

## CSV

Note: This grew into https://github.com/jimm/csvlixir which is now a
Hex/Expm package.

A CSV reader/writer for Elixir. Operates on strings and char lists. It'd be
very simple to provide file I/O.

## Midifile

A MIDI file reader/writer.

## Replayer

Replays an Apache log file.

## SimpleCache

A translation to Elixir of the simple cache application from _Erlang and OTP
in Action_.

## TCP RPC

A translation to Elixir of an exercise from _Erlang and OTP in Action_.

## YAML

Converts the output of `:yamerl_constr` into a list of Elixir maps.
See the [README](yaml/README.md).
